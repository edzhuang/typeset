# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** July 27, 2025

### 1. Overview

Welcome to **Typeset** (`https://typeset.im`) (the “**Service**”), an online, AI‑powered, collaborative LaTeX editor that lets users draft, compile and share LaTeX documents. These Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) form a legally binding agreement between you and **Eddie Zhuang** (“**Typeset**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

### 2. Who May Use the Service

Typeset is intended for users of any age; however, by using the Service, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement in your jurisdiction. Parents or guardians are responsible for supervising use by minors.

### 3. Account Registration & Security

You may need to create an account to use certain features. You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date. You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activity under your account.

### 4. Description of the Service

Typeset allows you to:

- Create, edit and compile LaTeX documents in your browser.
- Collaborate with others in real time.
- Store your documents on our servers.

All documents are **private by default** unless you explicitly share them.

### 5. User‑Generated Content

#### 5.1 Your Rights

You retain all ownership rights to the content (including LaTeX source, images, and other assets) you upload or create (“**User Content**”).

#### 5.2 Limited License to Typeset

You grant Typeset a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, store, display and process your User Content **solely to operate and improve the Service**.

#### 5.3 Responsibility for Content

You are solely responsible for your User Content. You must ensure it does not violate any laws, infringe intellectual‑property rights or contain harmful code.

### 6. Prohibited Activities

You agree not to:

- Upload unlawful, defamatory or infringing content.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service.
- Reverse‑engineer or attempt to access the Service’s source code.
- Use automated systems (bots, scrapers) that burden our infrastructure.

### 7. Intellectual Property

Except for User Content, all software, text, graphics, logos and other materials in the Service are owned by or licensed to Typeset and are protected by applicable laws. You may not reproduce or distribute them without prior written permission.

### 8. Privacy

Your use of the Service is also governed by our **Privacy Policy** (if published separately). By using Typeset, you consent to the collection and use of information as described therein.

### 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided **“as is” and “as available”** without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non‑infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation.

### 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, **Typeset’s total liability** for any claim arising from or relating to the Service is limited to **the greater of (a) CAD 100 or (b) the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim (currently CAD 0)**. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages.

### 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Typeset and its affiliates from any claims, damages or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

### 12. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you:

- Are required to do so by law.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. You may request deletion of your User Content by emailing **[support@typeset.im](mailto:support@typeset.im)**.

### 13. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada** without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles. Any dispute shall be resolved exclusively in the courts located in Ontario, Canada, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

### 14. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will notify you (e.g., via email or a banner). Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
