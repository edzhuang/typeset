### 5. Cookies and Similar Technologies

Typeset uses first‑party cookies and local storage for session management and Clerk authentication. Vercel Analytics may set its own cookies to capture anonymized usage statistics. Most browsers let you control or block cookies through settings, but core functionality may break if you disable them.

### 6. Data Retention

- **Active accounts:** Data is retained for as long as your account remains active.
- **Inactive accounts:** Accounts and associated documents are stored indefinitely unless you delete them.
- **Deletion requests:** You can delete your account and data at any time in the account settings or by emailing **[support@typeset.im](mailto:support@typeset.im)**. Deletions are processed within 30 days, barring data required for legal or security reasons.

### 7. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to, and stored on, servers in the **United States** or other jurisdictions where Vercel and AWS operate. By using the Service, you consent to these transfers. We rely on contractual safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable) to protect your data.

### 8. Security Measures

We implement industry‑standard safeguards, including:

- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Access‑controlled databases and storage
- Regular backups and monitoring
- Least‑privilege access policies for staff and systems

No method of transmission or storage is 100 percent secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 9. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access, correct, or delete your personal data
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent
- Lodge a complaint with a data‑protection authority

Canadian users’ data is handled in accordance with **PIPEDA**. We additionally honor key **GDPR** rights for users in the European Economic Area.

### 10. Children’s Privacy

Typeset is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that such data has been collected, we will delete it promptly. Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us information should contact us at **[support@typeset.im](mailto:support@typeset.im)**.

### 11. Changes to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced via the Service (e.g., banner or email). Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
